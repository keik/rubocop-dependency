### Dependency/OverBoundary

Check not to refer constants over dependency boundaries which given from `Rules` config.

When the following `Rules` is given,

```yaml
Rules:                        # Array of each rules
  - BannedConstPatterns: Foo  # Array<String> | String. This value is used as Regexp pattern.
    FromNamespacePatterns:    # Array<String> | String. This value is used as Regexp pattern.
      - \ABar(\W|\z)
```

The following code is considered problems.

```ruby
class Bar
  Foo
  ^^^ Const `Foo` cannot use from namespace `Bar`.
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
